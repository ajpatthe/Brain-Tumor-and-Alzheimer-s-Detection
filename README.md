This paper talks about using Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNNs) to find brain tumors and diagnose 
Alzheimer's disease from medical images like brain MRIs. 
They provide two sets of code: one for training the CNN 
models ('mainTrain.py') and another for testing these models 
('mainTest.py'). The beginning of the paper explains how they 
train the CNN models using TensorFlow and Keras libraries 
on MRI data. They prepare the dataset for training by 
adjusting images, splitting them into training and validation 
sets, and organizing them properly. The CNN structure 
includes layers for processing images and making predictions, 
and they carefully choose settings for accuracy. After training, 
they check how well the model works. In 'mainTest.py', they 
show how to use the trained model to detect brain tumors in 
images. They use the PIL library to handle images and follow 
specific rules to prepare them for the model. The code predicts 
the likelihood of different classes, helping to identify tumors. 
They also discuss using CNNs for diagnosing Alzheimer's 
disease. Overall, the paper demonstrates how CNNs can be valuable in medical image analysis.
